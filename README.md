# Denops Rust library
Now not working well!:
Now it's under developing to be compatible with denops 0.16, so please wait a little!

## About

Usually, We can use typescript to create vim plugin with typescript and any wasm binding, but sometimes need to call
some API from rust, and then this is useful!

Read this [article](https://zenn.dev/kkiyama117/articles/2021-03-01-denops-rust) also.

## Todo

- [ ] Add type and trait wrapping `denops-deno` and `denops-deno-std`
